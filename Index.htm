          <p>My best friend is Thet Hnin. She is not only my best friend but also my girlfriend. We first met each other at school when we were in grade 7. We are just friends until we finished grade 10. After that, I asked her to be my girlfriend then she accepted. At the weekend, we make snacks by ourselves and have them together. Sometimes, we go around Mandalay and take some photos. Being my best friend, Hnin is also very kind to me as a girlfriend. Hnin can understand my weakness, faults, and problems. When I need motivation, the only solution is confiding in her as she stays strong and always advises me. I am so proud to be someone she loves. I know my family is essential for my life, but Hnin is also important nevertheless.</p>
